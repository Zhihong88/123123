**Creation of trips** <br>
One of the app's main features; without it, it would not be a planning app. Using Recyclerview and View Holder, created trips are then displayed on the Homescreen.

**Layout / UI design**<br>
Using Figma, I created a UI design prototype. Making sure that the design is clean and modern, while also being simple enough to translate into code. Also responsible of the most of of the layout constraints in Android Studio.

**Creation of profile screen** <br>
To allow for user profile setup and identification, very much possibly needed for future implementations. It allows for storage of user's information such as name and home country and also a profile picture for the user. 

**Set up of firebase storage** <br>
Setting up rules to ensure only authenticated users are allowed to read and write data from the cloud storage. Also set up the standardised path that future implementations will be using when storing of photos and videos are needed

**User Authentication/Log-in/Forget password** <br>
Enabling user to register for an account and authenticate in order to save all of their data in the cloud (Firebase). If a user forgets their password, they can choose to change it by selecting the forget password option.

**Created Currency Converter** <br>
One useful feature of the currency converter is that it has the most frequently used currencies in it and can be converted interchangeably, enabling you to simplify your planning by accessing simple but yet important things such as exchange rates.  Unfortunately as APIs for live updated currencies cost a monthly fee or were not updated I was not able to implement one and had to instead hard code it out. I also added another tab at the bottom of the screen at the home page for ease of navigation to the currency converter.

**Creation of Activities** <br>
One of the main feature of the app - Allows users to add travel Itineraries to their travels. Using Recyclerview and View Holder, created activities are then displayed on the Activities Page. Allow users to add the Itinerary name, location (which is autofilled with google autocomplete places api), time of event. Helps users to plan their trips properly.
